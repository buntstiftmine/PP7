## Task 1
# Preprocess
By running the command "gcc -E solutions/sample.c -o solutions/sample.i" the information in file sample.c is accessed from the included libraries and written into a new file sample.i. The new ".i" file includes the whole studio.h library with all included functions. Furthermore, in sample.i predefined macros are replaced with their associated value.

# Compile to assembly
The command "gcc -S solutions/sample.i -o solutions/sample.s" generated a file, here "sample.s", which contains the information in a language that your machine is able to process. Therefore, the content of "sample.i" is translated/compiled into assambly instructions.

# Assemble
The assembler created an object file sample.o based on sample.s by running "gcc -c solutions/sample.s -o solutions/sample.o". The object file is written in machine language and consists of a series of zeros and ones.

# Link
The contents of the .o file are linked with missing functions in the available libraries to create the executable file "sample. So the command "gcc solutions/sample.o -o solutions/sample" created an executable file with functions of the .o file but in commands that your processor is able to understand.

## Task 2
# grep
With the grep command the text file is searched for parts that contain a specific phrase, here printf. The result is given as an output as well as the line where it was found, here line 4.

#sed
The sed command replaces printf with debug_printf in the whole file.

#awk
The awk command is similar to the grep function but with the possibility of only searching in a predefined range of lines.

#vim interactive
You can search "/printf" and replace ":%s/printf/debug_printf/g" when working in the vim editor. With "/printf" the search results are visually highlighted in the editor.

#vim CLI
This procedure allows you to execute the same steps as in interactive vim but without opening the editor.
